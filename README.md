# The-XIV

  hobby project - working towards creating a raid availability/scheduling application. Using Apollo GraphQL Server to query the REST api 
  for FFXIV game data, and Apollo Client with React on the front end. As a stretch the GraphQL server has been setup in such a way that 
  you can add multiple datasources and expand the app functionality beyond just FFXIV. 

## Status

  Currently building GraphQL server and types, as well as implementing a very minimal Front End to start basic search functionality, 
  and to verify data is being passed to the Front End through Apollo properly - 7/13/19
